Welcome back from reading week bitch
======================================

Alternative to GoFi
   - give up the idea that AI is language like
    
Back Propogation and training (tinkering)
    - bad because its another supiroir person to give it inteliigence

Generation -> Recognition cycle

Plasticity / Learning

#I cant pay attention

=== End of Review ===

Successes of Connections
    - very good at picking up on patterns in a non descersive?
    - something within us learns about complex patterns in an enviroment
    - explaining language is problematic for NN
    - but skill knowledge is bad for GoFi (but not for NN)
    - what you find salient and relevant

Skillful interaction is important in the world
     
Neural Networks can pickup on complex patterns with multiple constraints
    - NNs are not bounded by logic (relations)
    - can do chicken and egg problems

"Ahh" sound, and we are hearing them the same
    - even though the pitch is NOT the same
    - categorical perception

Arthur Reber - was trying to learn language
    - *implicit learning* - learning going on outside our effort
    - artificial grammar, makes random strings (aklssal)
        - then given a new data set (one that follows the grammar above, and the ones that dont)
        - then they must sort them
        - people reliably score well above chance
    - its a kind of learning / pattern detection
    - if you can explain implicit learning -> can teach intuition
    - a lot of learning is intuitivley driven

Graceful Degredation
    - if he turned down the lights in here slowly, we'd slowly lose our ability
    - gofi failes when the lights are turned off
        - ex. when you take a line out of code, it can fall drastically
    - NNs brought up things that GoFi couldnt explain

NN brings evidence that cognition is computation

Smolensky and Others
    - fundamental in setting up the debate on connectionism
    - Foder vs Smolensky -  big debate about connectionism (GoFi vs Connectionism)
        - 

Foder and Zenon Pylyshyn
    - emulate a program to act like a neural network
    - what are the two different claims about the nature of cognition (between NN and GoFi)
        - evidence that a NN that can do computation = cognition
        - constrain a NN to operate
    - not WHAT the machines do, but their STATEMENTS about cognative science

patterns of coactivation
    - NNs cannot rely on propositional structures (and inferences based on them)
        - means they are relying on computation
        - number of thoughts gets worsed as you get more nodes
            - has trouble distinguishing 
            - associations have trouble distinguishing
Truth Preservation
    - give a non propostional account of how Truth is Preserved
        - NNs need an alternative to GoFi on this point
    - we don't have an alternative theory for how truth is preserved
        - have to find a non accountual theory of computation
    - its a crazy argument, you don't have thoughts, its just truth and falcity
    - nearly none of our behavior is belief driven, its salient (skill based)
        - driven by approciacy 
    - only theory we have is logic

Finite Limited System => produce massive productivity of thought (compositionality by being like a language)
    - COMPOSTIONALITY IS A LANGUAGE LIKE EXPLINATION
    - as soon as they say that they give evidence to GoFi

Systemeticity
    - a mind that could think can think of A but not B
        A. John loves Susan
        B. Susan loves John
    - our minds are deeply systematic

NNs vs GoFi
------------

GoFi - you network theoriests havent solved anything we havent solved (train problem, relevant problem, purposefullness)
    - how much of your cognition is pascal vs descartes VS propositions / beliefs / inferences

A lot of your cognition is not computation

Duel Processing Models
    - idea that we have 2 different, styles of processing
        s1 - Guessing, sorta just going on 
        s2 - this lecture rn, very demanding (have to pay attention) meticulus
    - perhaps we are a combination of both
    - attempting to combine these processes for AI
        - NN + standard computational machine
    - best answer to this debate is the hybrid answer
        - evidence is converging sides of evidence from psychology
