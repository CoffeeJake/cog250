Looking for convergence in Coginative Science

Gick and Holyoak (1980)(find experiments are counter intuitive, ie things are going wrong/werid)
    - Brain Tumor Example (Dundar Radiation Problem)
        - SENARIO: person has a brain tumor in the middle of their brain, can kill it but need to use a beam and tear through the brain
            - Answer 1: is several small low intensity gamma beams that destory the tumor
            - Answer 2: circular gamma beams (like it goes in a circle) which hits the tumor as it rotates around
    - get a bunch of people to read a story
        - the story is about a general who wants to attack a fortress, only 4 direcitons (NSEW), any road he chooses they will lose and be held
        - so instead they split up and converge on the fortress from each direction
    - distractor task (adjectives in the story)
    - then give them this Radiation Problem
    - the experiment is that some got just the story, some got distractor tasks...then suddenly given the Radiation Problem
    - ***results was that people who read the story made no difference in their solving of the problem***
        - these negative results also tries to argue whether humans are rational or not(ie vast majority are irrational)

Lockheart, Lamon, and Gick
    - Pointed out how experiment above had similarities and differences between Fortress and Radiation
        - those 2 stories are propositionally similar(forces converging to destory a centeral target)
        - Fortress task is to read and undersatand an existing solution
        - Radiation is about figuring out how to solve it
            - although similar in proposition VERY DIFFERENT in procedure (for solving)
            - akin to how thinking outside the box did not really help
            - people said these senarios were "werid"

    - so instead they found a problem where ignorace wouldnt be an issue
        - "A man from a small town in the USA married 20 different women in the same town, and he did not divorce them, and he broke no laws"
            - Hes a Clergyman
        - 2 acceptable meanings for the word "marriage"
        - we all had the knowledge we just had to SHIFT ATTENTNION from the salient def of marry to the non-salient

    - They presented people with a bunch of sentences to read(most were irrelevant)(one was relevant)(2 forms for the relevance of the sentence)
        - Declaritive Form: "It made the clergyman happy to marry several people each week"
        - Puzzle Form: "The man married several people each week because it made him happy" waits for a sec...then the word "clergyman" appears
            - both essentially do the same thing
            - in one of them you need to shift attention from Dominant meaning to SubDominant but legitament
            - 2nd form is proceduarly similar to what you need to do to solve the insight problem, only the 2nd do you need to go through cog operations
        - Then unexpectedly they are given the multiple marriage problem (see above)
            - declaritive form does not help people sovle it
            - puzzle form showed significant facilitation for solving
        - **convergeing with memory (transfer appropriate processing)**

- When your brain recieves a problem it will look for past FAILED problem attempts (not Success ones)
    - implements Notice heuristic to change problem formulation when they are in common with problems in your head
    - Create 2 banks of problems [1. Easily Solvable 2. Impass Problems]- both are analogous to the Mutilated Chessboard
    - people can solve problems when they see problems that they have failed before vs analogous answers
    - humble people are more wise, due to humble people are willing to admit to their failures and address them

notice that in both propositional and procedural lanugauge is being used, language is priming insight
    *** language used per-say is being used to trigger insight *** (counter to verbal overshadowing)
    - its not langugae per-say that hinders, but instead helps to trigger
    - processess that are automatic dont allow us to explain things, but insight is de-automizing to allow change bewtween problem fomulation (vauge)

The Return of Wiseberg  (1995)
    - Vervake disagrees with points, but loves him for advancing science
    - Highly critical of insight research
        1. Metcalf and etc, treat insight problems as if they exist (if some state of affairs are JUST inisght problems)(paints them black and white)
            - points out that this objectivness is a false assumption, "the universe does not have any problems"
            - Universe just operates, things are not actually a problem...remember that problems dont exsit but only in relation to things in the world
            - Attempts to change behavior towards events, and pay attention to the meaning given to events in the world
            - problems WERE insight problems, but once solved are no longer insight problems
            - Child candy example (2 rows, one is more spaced out) - children pick the 2nd one, because it takes up more space.
                - we become fixated on the one different variable
                - but now that we are older we realize we need to look at multivariable
                - its no longer an insight problem
