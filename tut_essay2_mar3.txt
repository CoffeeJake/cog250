    HOW TO KEEP YOUR VOICE IN CHECK
- your voice is always present throughout the quotes and arguements
    - not 1. research 2. explinations

- when you do your research just let it naturally flow, then keep the philosophy part in check for an angle on how to argue
    - but decide after you get your research
