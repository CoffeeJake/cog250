Dualism ** (descartes argument)
    - descartes argument based around mind / matter
    - Mind: meaning / truth / purpose / qualia / x / x / x (the ones mentioned are the essential properties of mind) (essence)
    - Matter: x / x / x / x / extended / energy / resistance (same for the matter)(essence)
        - they are "Essentially Different"

    "How to save the argument"
        - treat it not as inductive
        - inference to the best explination (IBE)

    All science works in the idea that many theoeries -> to one thing (ex proto / classical / etc)

Possible that this argument is not technically valid
    - entire history of AI still hasnt solved the problems hes exposed

Quine - the essential properties are the ones that allow you to do science 
    - broad / deep generalizations

If dualism is right, then they could not causalty interact
    - it can only be used as evidence if there was a relation between the two

Most of our experience becomes, inexplainable


Body -> nervous -> animal spirits
(goo bridges the two) (rejected this answer, it did nothing)
    - ultimentally its still physical stuff 
Mind

- needed a soultion for the body-mind problem for dualism

Malbranche
    - occasionalism
        - mind and body CANT interact
        - a thought in your mind -> god looks at it -> then your body moves
        - same happens in reverse (getting hit -> feeling pain)
        - evoking that something even crazier exists (god)

Leibniz - consider causation for correlation 
    - look at the REVERSE   
    - a pre-established harmony
    - god set up this relation

Correlation vs Causation

cartesian dualism / substance dualism
    - body decays but the mind can somehow exist
    - presents a difficult existential challenge

Property Dualism
    - two types of properties
    - analogy: sodium + chlorine = salt
    - hydrogen + oxygen = h20 (water)
        - salt has properties that its parts dont have
        - this is not a sum of parts?
        - water cannot exist independently

brain process <+> brain process = mental properties

disanalogy at the core of the analogy, brain processes go from physical to non-physical
    - the analogy is not an analogy (because of physical to non-physical)

epiphenomalism - a causal effect, but never can cause it
    - OTHER things can cause it

somethings capacity to ACT (cause things to happen)

elementary property dualism
    - elemental to our whole framework
    - explaining time (i know what time is until you ask me)
    - i dont have to explain them, because elementally they are the same level
        - (mental vs physical properties)

panpsychism - everything contains mind
    - pan = all

- arent making any progress preserving dualism

Materialists

Idealism - everything is an illusion
    - illusions only exists in the mind
    - if im dreaming of a heavy rock, is there really one

Berkeley 
Matter is real - primary proper ties are objective
    - you never know for sure, just 2ndary qualities...we infer from that

To be, is to be preceved
    - do not exist independant to our aweareneess
    - stuff happens when im not watching it
