Metcalfe - researcher on meta cognition
    - uses a cognative probe
        - Strup effect - colored ink (ex word "Blue" in orange ink)(interfernece effect)(due to automatic reading)
            - in the idea of "no insight" they claim you are just doing a really deep memory search
        - 1986 Feeling of Knowing (FOK)
            - ask if we can rememeber something
            - "Oh i know that" where you sorta feel something about knowing
                - a GOOD indicator of successful memory search
                - FOK => memory serach = "insight"
                    - which means FOK = "insight"
            - other than FOK being successful, also found it didnt not help solving an insight problem        
            - provides good evidence that something other than memory search is going on with problem solving
            - compare insight vs incremental problems 

Metcalfe and Wiebe 1987 (FEELING OF WARMTH)
    - insght problems and non insight problems
    - and providing feeling of warmth indicators every 10 seconds
    - 2 predicitons
        - 1. feeling of warmth would accuratly predict for non-insight
        - 2. a difference in the curves for feeling of warmth between the two problems
    - (non-insight - risiing curve) vs (insight - SUDDEN change)

Tausovec (1989, 1994)
Jousouvec and Bekraceuis (1995)
    - replicated experiement along with recording heart rate
        - (non insight - slope line going consistantly) vs (insight - curve that geos much faster towards the end)

Kaplen and Simon (1990) "In Search of Insight"
    - attempting to explain Insight, but not challenged the Search Inference Framework
        - proposing two search spaces
            - 1. Primary - first you serach here (in the regular rules)
            - 2. Meta - then you serach here (then you searech for problem formulation)
                - the idea is you use Primary, realize its not working, go to Meta for reforming the problem, then solving back at Primary
            - INSIGHT IS WHEN YOU SWITCH SPACES, GO BACK, AND THEN SOVLE IT
