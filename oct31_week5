(no review)

- should have already started working on the essay (yeah i probobly should)

Cotter's point - interconnection between memory and problem solving
- cogsci has the endevour of addressing this major interconnection

- the core of cognition is intelligence (if we can do this we achieve the naturalistic imperitive)

Intelligence = the capacity to being a general problem solver(DESIGN - if we created a autonomas problem solving artifical int)
    - general problem solver is an entity or system is something that can solve a wide variety of problems in a wide variey of domains(emphasis on wide)
    - Newel and Simon1(1955 a general problem solver)(GPS)(held in high reguard for the "Gold Standard" for what it means to do CogSci)
        - had to do the generalizing of what it means to solve a problem
            PROBLEMS (4 COMPONENTS)
                1. Initial state is DIFFERENT from the 2. goal state (imagine two circles far from one another)(thirsty vs not thirsty)
                3. operators (operations you can perform to change states)(now imagine a (n-tree) with each action being walking/drinking/etc)(abstract problem space)
                4. Path Constraints (possible solutions but are detrimental to things you need to solve)(are you gonna kill someone for water?)(cutting off your leg to kill pain)

        - the more of a general problem solver you are the more apparent detrimental path constraints are
- a general problem solver is any path that gets to the goal state while obeying path constraints
- a problem solving method is any tech for finding a problem solution
- the issue is that we can see the n-tree but we cannot see the whole tree from a birds eye view, instead we ARE the nodes
- Holyoak - gives a concrete example for counting the number of pathways is F^D (D = number of steps(60), F = nodes at a certain spot(30)) 
    - example he gives is a game of chess, on average you have about 30 moves you can perform, and on average 60 turns in a game
    - somehow as humans we can ignore unimportant things and just focus on the 4/5 moves we can make

Distigishing between algorithms and heuristics

algorithm = a problem solving method gaurenteed to generate a solution or prove its impossible(certainty is attatched to it)
    - algorithm for determining amount of people in this room(counting)
    - often algs issue because theres too much in the search space "Practically Impossible"
heuristic = a problem solving method that increases the probobability of completing a goal (no gaurentees)
    - chess strategies (getting queen out / defending king)(can still lose even practicing heuristic)

- live in a society where rational = logical(yet then this must be false there for ration!=logical)(since its nearly impossible for us as human beings to use algorithms)
- also rational != illogical

rationality is about when/where/what degree to be logical
our brains are constatnly using heuristics because we would not be able to do the other
    - the ISSUE with heuristic is that it creates a bias (ie in smash when you are playing from the centre you can abuse that as anohter player or techchasing correctly)
    - essay note (look up relating heuristics and algorithms in relation to game shows)

Two kinds of Heurstics
    1. Avaliability Heuristics - easier it is to remember something similar to x (or imagine x) the MORE proboable x is (when tom will spin as luigi to crouch cancel it)
    2. Reprosentetivness? - how categorical/prototypical the event is the MORE probabale x is(a situation you can see from VODs and other games even if its never happened)(plane crash)

The issues with GPS
2 Flawed assumptions
    1. All problems are essentially the same
    2. Problem formulation is a rather TRIVIAL affair
    - Newel and Simon are falling prey to "because we have a category means we have an essance)
    - problem solving methods seem to be indepence and interference
        - independance = swiming does not help with cog250
        - golf/hockey story = similar actions but the golf swing and the hockey swing are radically different
    - also fell prey to the differences between well definied vs ill defined
        - how a problem is how you set it up
        - a well defined problem is that you set it up WELL ENOUGH to apply methods to make it successful manor(multiplication)
        - ill defined state is that nothing can be clear to you so you dont know what methods to use (yet this is how most of the world works)
            - it LACKS good problem formulation(its the reason he does no slides)("Take good notes")(cant use synonems to relevant)
            - conversations with people
            - since most things are ill defined problems which is why (2) is such a detrimental thing
            - problem formulation is the MOST CRUCIAL for this state

Problem Formulation = the missing element, where much of the zeroing on relevant information (helps avoid explostion)
    - also deals with ill definededness

Kaplan and Simon (same simon)(1990) "Mutilated Chessboard" - title is Insight(how an unsolvable problem becomes solvable)
    - took a chess board and removed the top right/bottom left = both white squares, therefore impossible to cover with 31 dominos
    - depends on how you formulate the issue, one way leads to explosion the other leads to alg proofs to disprove(it is recursive and self correcting)
    - Intelligence => GPS => AFM problem solvers => Problem Formulation => Insight
    - the goal of intelligence is to avoid explosions
     
2 Core traditions talking about Insight
    1. using inference to search through a problem space(moving from one place to another)
    2. Gestalt - think of insight as perception than action

    Gestalt vs Simon
(Thorrdyke 1898) - (used to explain the Gestalt)
    - used cat and food in a box, food outisde box and needed to press a button to escpe
    - cat never really got it, it took a while

Gestalt (Kohler)
    - Saltan (a chimp), was in a cage and could play with boxes and there were bannans hanging above him
    - started stacking boxes to get bananas
    3 Problems
        1. no good theory
        2. not as rigourasly controlled as Thorrdyke's(there were better experiments later)
        3. he was german(issue was that it occured during ww1/ww2)(he was actually also a spy (google this))
    - 9 dot question where you had to draw a single line to draw everything, so it creates a fake bias(think of a square)(had to BREAK the fixation)

Weisberg and Alba (1981) - Work on the 9 Dot problem
    - would give them the problem
    - gave a clue "think outside the box"
    - but it didnt actually work(sorta renders the saying as unimportant)
    - trying to prove that there is NO insight
    - they are confusing necessity and sufficency
    - Single Diffiulty Hypothesis - multiple things make the 9 dot problem hard to solve
    - what did work was drawing a physical box around the 9 dots
    - there needs to be a distinction between declarative knowledge and procedural knowledge
        - declarative(propositional) - can declare many things (knowing THAT)(knowing facts)
        - procedural - knowing how (knowing how to ride a bike)

========= REVIEW ============== (LEARNING GOALS)

- General Problem Solver
- 4 components of problem solving
- path constraints
    - shows that you dont do things detrimental to yourself
- search space is cognatiority explosive (so big)
    - "practically impossible"
- problem solving includes not searching the whole space without killing yourself
- algs vs heuristics
- problem with heuristics is that it sometimes hinders us?
    - yet they are still necessary
- 2 flawed assumptions of newll and simons failures
    - 1. "All problems are the same"
    - 2. "Misconseption that classical was correct"
- well defined vs ill defined problems
    - most real world problems are ill defined problems
    - relevance is needed to avoid exploding
- power of problem formulation (mutilated chessboard)
- insight = good problem formulation from bad problem formulation
- two schools of insight
    -1. moving through a space (spatial metaphor)(metaphors are often repearted, yet often wrong) SEARCH INFERNECE FRAMEWORK
    -2. (Gestalt) Insight is something from perception (drawing a box for 9 dot problem)(think outside the box)
- thought that there was a single issue in the 9 dot problem
    - yet there are often more than just that
- insight is more like a skill than beliefs(like swimming or riding a bike)
