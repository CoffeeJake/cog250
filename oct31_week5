(no review)

- should have already started working on the essay (yeah i probobly should)

Cotter's point - interconnection between memory and problem solving
- cogsci has the endevour of addressing this major interconnection

- the core of cognition is intelligence (if we can do this we achieve the naturalistic imperitive)

Intelligence = the capacity to being a general problem solver(DESIGN - if we created a autonomas problem solving artifical int)
    - general problem solver is an entity or system is something that can solve a wide variety of problems in a wide variey of domains(emphasis on wide)
    - Newel and Simon1(1955 a general problem solver)(GPS)(held in high reguard for the "Gold Standard" for what it means to do CogSci)
        - had to do the generalizing of what it means to solve a problem
            PROBLEMS (4 COMPONENTS)
                1. Initial state is DIFFERENT from the 2. goal state (imagine two circles far from one another)(thirsty vs not thirsty)
                3. operators (operations you can perform to change states)(now imagine a (n-tree) with each action being walking/drinking/etc)(abstract problem space)
                4. Path Constraints (possible solutions but are detrimental to things you need to solve)(are you gonna kill someone for water?)(cutting off your leg to kill pain)

        - the more of a general problem solver you are the more apparent detrimental path constraints are
- a general problem solver is any path that gets to the goal state while obeying path constraints
- a problem solving method is any tech for finding a problem solution
- the issue is that we can see the n-tree but we cannot see the whole tree from a birds eye view, instead we ARE the nodes
- Holyoak - gives a concrete example for counting the number of pathways is F^D (D = number of steps(60), F = nodes at a certain spot(30)) 
    - example he gives is a game of chess, on average you have about 30 moves you can perform, and on average 60 turns in a game
    - somehow as humans we can ignore unimportant things and just focus on the 4/5 moves we can make

Distigishing between algorithms and heuristics

algorithm = a problem solving method gaurenteed to generate a solution or prove its impossible(certainty is attatched to it)
    - algorithm for determining amount of people in this room(counting)
    - often algs issue because theres too much in the search space "Practically Impossible"
heuristic = a problem solving method that increases the probobability of completing a goal (no gaurentees)
    - chess strategies (getting queen out / defending king)(can still lose even practicing heuristic)

- live in a society where rational = logical(yet then this must be false there for ration!=logical)(since its nearly impossible for us as human beings to use algorithms)
- also rational != illogical

rationality is about when/where/what degree to be logical
our brains are constatnly using heuristics because we would not be able to do the other
    - the ISSUE with heuristic is that it creates a bias (ie in smash when you are playing from the centre you can abuse that as anohter player or techchasing correctly)
    - essay note (look up relating heuristics and algorithms in relation to game shows)

Two kinds of Heurstics
    1. Avaliability Heuristics - easier it is to remember something similar to x (or imagine x) the MORE proboable x is (when tom will spin as luigi to crouch cancel it)
    2. Reprosentetivness? - how categorical/prototypical the event is the MORE probabale x is(a situation you can see from VODs and other games even if its never happened)(plane crash)

The issues with GPS
2 Flawed assumptions
    1. All problems are essentially the same
    2. Problem formulation is a rather TRIVIAL affair
    - Newel and Simon are falling prey to "because we have a category means we have an essance)
    - problem solving methods seem to be indepence and interference
        - independance = swiming does not help with cog250
        - golf/hockey story = similar actions but the golf swing and the hockey swing are radically different
    - also fell prey to the differences between well definied vs ill defined
        - how a problem is how you set it up
        - a well defined problem is that you set it up WELL ENOUGH to apply methods to make it successful manor(multiplication)
        - ill defined state is that nothing can be clear to you so you dont know what methods to use (yet this is how most of the world works)
            - it LACKS good problem formulation(its the reason he does no slides)("Take good notes")(cant use synonems to relevant)
            - conversations with people
            - since most things are ill defined problems which is why (2) is such a detrimental thing
            - problem formulation is the MOST CRUCIAL for this state

Problem Formulation = the missing element, where much of the zeroing on relevant information (helps avoid explostion)
    - also deals with ill definededness
