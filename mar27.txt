lightning -> electricity appears to human beings
mental state - brain states appear to human being
    - to a mind, to subjective experiences

appearnece is subjective and therefore not apart of physics / neuroscience

Putnam / Fodar -> mulitple realizability - AI
    - created computational functionalism

pain states = c fibers firing

Computational Functionalism - mental states == computatoinal states
    - automatic formal system

Putnam & Fodar are also very big critics of their own theory

functoinally the same, but different!

1 Mental state
    - can produce infinitly many computational states
    - 

Cant say mental states are brain states, they can be other kinds of states

propositions + inferences + rules

propositions - logical identity (inference)
    - logical implications (cognitorial explosive)
    - cognitive commitmint (changing consisntatly depending on context)

(brown) conditions of application (rules)
    - "be kind"
    - relevance is not a deeply logical property

solution: 3rd generation cogsci
    - methodolgical change - determine mental properties
        - pick the problem that all our theories are running into
        - explain RELEVANCE REALIZATION


Represnetations = aspectual (cannot do relevance realization)
    - moduability (cannot explain most of your intullectual behavior)

Can't have a scientific theory of relevance
    - classes with systematic import (essence) (also need to be homogeous)
    - stable
    - intrinsic
    
=== break ===

- constatly evolving ones fitness to fit the enviroment
    - embedded in the relationship between the organism and its enviroment

Evan Thompsen - most important advocate of 3rd generation cogsci

self organization - their exists depends on them and not on us
    - multiple realizable
    - existing independant of us

biology is the answer? looking for systems

Dynamic Systems Theory

You can't ask what caused cause...that literally makes no sense (kant)

- self organizing things are circular causation
    - have to argue agaisnt the line of causation

cause -> event -> actually
constraint -> condition -> posibility (just as real)

actual = real

Selective Constraint = reduce possibilities
Enabling Constraint  = increase possibilities

scaricty of resource
    - kills off organisims
    - organisims evolution constantly shifting due to changing pressures
    - variance
    - virtual engine that is regulating a feedback process (def of dynamic system)
