 Tapping Object Experiment
============================

object -> probe -> hand

- attention is a mixture between subsidary awareness 
- Attention is a structural integration
- looking at the probe through our fingers
- using fingers to look at probe then probe to look at object
- attention is a recursivly layed process thats has to do with attention and awareness
- "transparancy to opacity shift"
    - looking through our glasses (double meaning)
    - taking off glasses and how you look at them
    - yet the experiment above was opacity to transparency shifts

A way for our attention to move
===============================
- bring about a fusion and manipulate waht you are paying attention to
- Big H made of tiny "l"s
- Gestalt = Global vs Fetulon = Locally (constantly shifting around, this is also no captured by the search light metaphor)
- Levels of Construl, moving up and down on a line to shift between Global and Locally, being Gestalt or a Feature is relative
- Small World but you would not want to draw it all
- its about the direction you're moving not where you end up***
- *drew a graph about moving between global/local and transparency/opacity*
- therefore the formal education of attention has been simplistic and debatably wrong

Vervake and Fevrarc 2016
=========================
- now hes showing us a graph that looks like a cartisean one with a diagonal line
- as you move more to the top right it looks like you are scaling up your attention
- and as you move down you scale 
- mindfulness practicess help you solve your problem solving ability 
1. mindfullness
2. attentional scaling and insight
3. mindfullness and insight

Meditation == Contemplation
yet 
Meditation != Contemplation

Meditation means to move towards the center of your own mind
Contemplation means "Theoria" , which leads to a theory and allows you to combine things to allow you to look at what they are sharing

Knoblich and Others (1999)
==========================
2 Processes that improve insight
    1. Chunk decomposition - the better people are at breaking up chunks the better they will be at insight (9 dot problem issues)
        - gestalt -> featural
    2. Constraint Relaxation - saying choke / stroke / oak / "white of an egg" instead we said "yolk"
        - have to de-automize ones cognition

Kang 2013 - de-automize your cognition
======================================
- automizeing cogition is training it to do things automatically
    - allows working memory to worry about other things (good example is driving)(high way hypnotism)
    - verbal overshadowing has nothing to do with language (like having to actually thinking about typing)
    - a *transparancy to opacity shift* is when you have to go from the background to the foreground, like the glassess example when you pull off your glasses and can see them

- objectivly proved that hypnotizing exists by using the strup test (colors and text) and they got better at solving it
- training in mindfullness minimizes the strup effect (trains you to de-automitize your cognition)
- the scaling down of attention can prove insight?
    - yet he is going to prove it all directions, scaling down of attention improves/doesnt improve insight
    - and same when it scales up

Forster and others (2004) & Hantend Carol (2008)
================================================
- seeing and creating dot pictures = scaling up (oh thats a picture of a naked woman)
- cognative leaping is also evidence for this (9 dots, and they turn the dots into a square)
- scaling down = overshadowing, causing people to choke and have issues
there is evidence in all directions

Deyoung, Flanders, and Peterson (2008)
========================================
- Breaking Frame 
    - "Anomalys card soring task"
    - flash pictures of playing cards and identifying an analomus card when it appears
    - calling out the different card means you can break frame
- Making Frame
    - not only do you have to destory your current frame but you have to generate a new frame

Phase-Function Fit
    - different phrases where you must either break frame (lower attention) and make frame (increase attention)
    - one must need to train this skill to scale down understand and generate new frames and being able to move between them
    - meditation

Ren and Others (2010)
    - making people follow breath then do insight probelms leads to an increase

Attention is a complex self organizing process, that has capacity for scaling up and scaling down
Mindfulness trains this and allows for insight
Phase-Function fit allow syou to build up and down to solve problems

(moving into neuroscience)
Stephon and Dixon (2009)
=========================
    - Self organizing criticality(soc)
    - order is how do things before predict where things will go 
    - sand dripping into a container, it will "self organize"
    - criticality is about when its integrity is threatened, order and structure build, then an avalanche
    - works with sand example, sand piles up, then avalanches and base gets built, then gets higher

State Space Diagram
------------------
- the diagram was different levels, always measuring multiple variables
- attractor is a repeating pattern
- stephan and dixon used Takens(1981)
- had people solving something called the "gear" problem, figure out how gears are shifting
    - insight is when people just add together the gears
    - measure when people are looking or looking at them pointing
    - graph of entrophy and time and how it just goes up and down, but intorducing entrophy actually increases insight
    - breaking frame, by adding disorder to the picture on the screen
        - this provoked insight
        - verbal overshadowing provokes insight
    - incubation = stop thinking about it and it passes into unconsious (THIS IS WRONG)
    - incubation does work, only when you are moderatly distracted from the problem, not super distracted, upon returning you can solve it

Network Theory (Graph Theroy) - study of how things are connected
--------------
- how computers are connected on the internet
- how website links are conneted to one another
- can be used to study many connected systems, many have things in common
- 3 Types of Networks (same number of nodes, same number of connections)
    1. Regular network, one node to another, (1 step connection) (High in Resilliancy, Low Efficiency)
    2. Random Chaotic Network (random, jumbled around) (High efficiency, low resilliancy)
    3. Small World Network - most networks IRl look like this (high efficiency, high resilliancey)

- People looked at the economics of these networks (efficiency vs stability)
    - take a single point and count how long it takes to get to different points (Mean Path Distance) - efficiency
    - fault tolerance - how much damage can a network take while it can still function

Schilling (2005) 
- Small World is really just regular network with some diagonally drawn paths
- Insight is sorta like a flash of consiousness, says this is whats happening in brain when you have an insight

Self organizing criticality to Small world network which is inherinetly insight
- yet nowhere in here can we avoid explosion or relevance
