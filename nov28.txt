 Tapping Object Experiment
============================

object -> probe -> hand

- attention is a mixture between subsidary awareness 
- Attention is a structural integration
- looking at the probe through our fingers
- using fingers to look at probe then probe to look at object
- attention is a recursivly layed process thats has to do with attention and awareness
- "transparancy to opacity shift"
    - looking through our glasses (double meaning)
    - taking off glasses and how you look at them
    - yet the experiment above was opacity to transparency shifts

A way for our attention to move
- bring about a fusion and manipulate waht you are paying attention to
- Big H made of tiny "l"s
- Gestalt = Global vs Fetulon = Locally (constantly shifting around, this is also no captured by the search light metaphor)
- Levels of Construl, moving up and down on a line to shift between Global and Locally, being Gestalt or a Feature is relative
- Small World but you would not want to draw it all
- its about the direction you're moving not where you end up***
- *drew a graph about moving between global/local and transparency/opacity*
- therefore the formal education of attention has been simplistic and debatably wrong

Vervake and Fevrarc 2016

- now hes showing us a graph that looks like a cartisean one with a diagonal line
- as you move more to the top right it looks like you are scaling up your attention
- and as you move down you scale 
- mindfulness practicess help you solve your problem solving ability 
1. mindfullness
2. attentional scaling and insight
3. mindfullness and insight

Meditation == Contemplation
yet 
Meditation != Contemplation

Meditation means to move towards the center of your own mind
Contemplation means "Theoria" , which leads to a theory and allows you to combine things to allow you to look at what they are sharing

Knoblich and Others (1999)

2 Processes that improve insight
    1. Chunk decomposition - the better people are at breaking up chunks the better they will be at insight (9 dot problem issues)
        - gestalt -> featural
    2. Constraint Relaxation - saying choke / stroke / oak / "white of an egg" instead we said "yolk"
        - have to de-automize ones cognition

Kang 2013 - de-automize your cognition
- automizeing cogition is training it to do things automatically
    - allows working memory to worry about other things (good example is driving)(high way hypnotism)
    - verbal overshadowing has nothing to do with language (like having to actually thinking about typing)
    - a transparancy to opacity shift is when you have to go from the background to the foreground, like the glassess example when you pull off your glasses and can see them

- objectivly proved that hypnotizing exists by using the strup test (colors and text) and they got better at solving it
- training in mindfullness minimizes the strup effect (trains you to de-automitize your cognition)
- the scaling down of attention can prove insight?
    - yet he is going to prove it all directions, scaling down of attention improves/doesnt improve insight
    - and same when it scales up

Forster and others (2004) & Hantend Carol (2008)
- seeing and creating dot pictures = scaling up (oh thats a picture of a naked woman)
- cognative leaping is also evidence for this (9 dots, and they turn the dots into a square)
- scaling down = overshadowing, causing people to choke and have issues
there is evidence in all directions

Deyoung, Flanders, and Peterson (2008)
- Breaking Frame 
    - "Anomalys card soring task"
    - flash pictures of playing cards and identifying an analomus card when it appears
    - calling out the different card means you can break frame
- Making Frame
    - not only do you have to destory your current frame but you have to generate a new frame

Phase-Function Fit
    - different phrases where you must either break frame (lower attention) and make frame (increase attention)
    - one must need to train this skill to scale down understand and generate new frames and being able to move between them
    - meditation

Ren and Others (2010)
    - making people follow breath then do insight probelms leads to an increase

Attention is a complex self organizing process, that has capacity for scaling up and scaling down
Mindfulness trains this and allows for insight
Phase-Function fit allow syou to build up and down to solve problems
