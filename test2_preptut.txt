(not cumulitive) from test 1 onward from memory onward

2 sections: 1. short answer - definitional / fitting it in historically(context) / course argument / tell critisim / issues with it
                    (prorobly answer 4)
            2. long answer - essay / very broad question of prompt
                    (3/4 topics)
                    - expect a thesis (set them up for essay)
                    - intro / tesis / body / (well thought our answer)
                    - different strategies - referecnce questions(but dont do it all through that)
                        - use timeing for the firs exam to decide how to approach
                        - look at the whole thing and back reference/list points once you get to something relevant

pay attention to mark breakdown
- can reference short answer in long answer, carefully

Timeline
----------
Memory -> Intelligence -> Problem Solving -> insight -> attention - > ai (objective and not subjective)

Memory -> Int
    - cotters point: that memory + problem solving = cognition

Int -> Problem Solving
    - if intelligence = being a good general problem solver
    - then we need to explore problem solving

Problem Solving -> insight
    - arose from problems that could not be formulated properly for solving

Insight -> Attention
    - insight's main issue was setting up problems to be solved, many experiments/theories came in
    - but attention stood out
    - attention is not something you do, but how you do other things

Attention -> AI
    - I'm not sure
