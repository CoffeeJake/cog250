Test format: 1. short essay answer (like t1)
             2. longer argumentative essay (4 choices) (tracing lines of development and theories)(cross lectures)
                - may refer to short essay answers in long one (good idea to read long before) (NO MORE THAN ONE)
                - budget your time, and coordinate your answers (make a mind map to see this)
                - same format as this to the final
                - dont mearly review material, have to add my own argument / critically engage

=== Lecture Begins ===

=== Review Begins ===
- last week was a pre-history of AI
- strong AI is deeply intertwined with another scientific revolution
- aristotle non-conformity = funciton doesnt follow the shape
- things are active on purpose
- cognition still operates on an aristotlian manor
- math becomes a cenral part of science

everything that is real can be grouped into symbols that can be completed in a mathematical manor
    - everything else is just subjective stuff 

Hobbs came to the conclusion that cognition is computation
    - purly material entites can do computation
    - brain is just a machine running computations
    - through this he claims artifical intelligence
    - "we have nothing like a soul"

Descartes response
    - when you reason, you are trying to get closer to the truth
    - "no meaning in matter"
    - when something is mechanical it cant be operating in terms of meaning in truth
        *MECHANICAL PARADOX*
    - no way manipulating matter can explain consiousness
    - all his arguments come from the current scientific revolution

not everyone agrees with this, but they should
    - this is the OG debate, the standard that was set

Strong AI is to build a machine with good explination that hobbs is right, and how/why descartes is wrong
    - if strong AI wins, the natrualistic imperitive will be solved

Weak Ai means how much evidence it provides, doesn't mean its actually weak
    - just doesnt prove Hobbs claim
    - Weak AI's succes != Strong Ai's success

=== End of Review ===

The Simulation Problem
    - what tests can we use to prove Strong AI
it may even be the case that the mind is not a material thing (epistemic boundedness issue) 

"What is a computer?"
    - what does he mean by it that a computer is, not what physically makes a computer
    - analyze / formalize what hobbs meant when he says cognition is computation

Houdlin = a computer is an interpreted automatic formal system
    - central claim: formal system

What do you need for a formal system? (formal game) (example monopoly)
    1. Rules - inital configuration
    2. Tokens - pecies you play with, starting configuration

Rules -> configuration of tokens -> new configuration of tokens -> Rules -> etc(now start over, its an endless cycle)

Formal Game = all that matters is the relation between tokens, rules work in the relations between tokens
    - we attatch meaning to the tokens (house, hotel, dogbowl is me)
    - yet the rules + tokens cycle still goes on whether we give meaning or not
    - a formal system is *COMPLETELY SELF CONTAINTED*
    - meaning is irrelevant for a formal game
        - also why a computer is able to play formal games like monopoly
        - it doesnt matter what the tokens PHYSICALLY ARE, as long as you can use them in accordance to the rules(formal system)

*some games depends on specific properties*
    - football is the classic example

is our mind more like chess or football?
    - if chess its very plausible, specific rules to produce things (chemicals, nuron)
    - if its like football then itll be much harder

Formal Equivalence = a 1 to 1 corespondance betewen systems
    - football doesnt work this way, since there are things you can do that depend on the actual physics

Medium Independant = tokens can be of any form, as long as they can be manipulated

formal equivalence + medium independance = multiple realizability
    - can be realized in a computer and the mush of our brain
    - if they are formally equivalent, computer literally has a mind

you make the "token world connection" - what gives a token its power
    - if this is correct then strong ai is very plausible

token vs type
    - a dime, a nickle, a quarter
    - 3 tokens
    - 3 types
    - 6 subway tokens, but 1 type
        - both belong to two seperate formal systems
    - taking a token, and moving it around
    - rules also work in confirugration of tokens

formal relations between the tokens = The Software (mind)
    - the matter of the tokens is irrelevant
    - software moves around seperatly from the hardware

causel interactions between mentioned tokens = hardware (brain)

can't reduce chess to pecies of wood or plastic, many things work this way
    - what makes it chess is how it operates of functions

tension between (1)AI is near and (2)neruoscience is required for brain/mind understanding
    - might also be the timing of a feature

Pascal - on his own her remade euclinian geometry
    - invented probabilty theory
    - all while staying in his own room

    - made a distinction between the spirit of geometry, and the spirt of finese
        - all that matters in gemoery is the order and the formal locations of the tokens
            - all triangles have the same formal features
        - most of our behavoir that we find meaningful has finese
    - represents we are not a formal system, and that we are something beyond that

Elements of a formal system
    - a process thats digital in nature
        - "digital" = a set of techniques that will help the system be self contained
            - processes that are POSITIVE and RELIABLE
                - positive = a technique that will be successful agaisnt a set of standards
                - reliable = high percetage that frequently succeds

'read' = a system has a teqnique for determining the locaction and types of tokens
'write' = given tokens, to manipulatie according to the rules of a formal system
    - read/write cycle -> in a circle
        - after written, it needs to be read again before being written again

'Positive and reliable methods for a read write system' (keeps it going) 
    - read/write cycle keeps it as a self contained cycle
