=== Review ====

- dualism
- mind body problem
- occasionalism
- so many things require GOD
- substance dualism / property dualism
- elemental dualism
- rejecting dualism
    - property dualism
- if youre not a dualst your a monoist
- materialism (physicalism)
    - all that actually exists are the entities talked about in physics
- barkley debated that objective realizty is dependant on secondary qualities
    - no access to primary qualities (dependant on mental properties)
- idealism requires God
    - good evidence to believe that things existsted
- even parts of your own mind arent explainable without god
    - no such thing as subconsious thought

Problems with Idealism
    - what do we mean by "real" 
    - judgement about realness matters
    - struggle between value of a relationship and the state they are in
    - 1. consiousness is where your mind directly, how do you know that you are consious?
    - you are consious when you are consious
        - subjectivity
    - 2. the mind connect with itself in consiousness -> the touch stone for consiousness
        - math's primary qualities that define reality

    2 definitions: Subjectivity vs Objectivity
    - no consistnat standard of realness
    - which one of these standards we give priority to 
    - math went to science (objectivity)
        - have to give good reason to accepting subjectivity
    - 3rd generation of cogsci tries to link the relationship between these two sides

    Physicalism
        - logical behaviorism - metholodgical behaviorism
            - idea that behavior can and always can be explained by physical behavior
        - philosophical behaviorism - (Ryle)
            - Ryle proposed that the relationship betewen mind / body shouldnt be solved, but instead dissolved
            - "i want to see the university"
        - occurent - dispositional = not secret, natural / normal
        - Ryle says they are either statements of behavior
            - or statments about the disposition of behavior
        - all these divisons that descartes creates, dont exist
            - instead of talking about dispositions 
            - realizing we should be using the terms following philosophical grammar
    6 Reasons why Philosphical Behaviorsim doesn't work
    Philosphical Grammar cannot be chosen as the main choice (dependant on common sense and intuition)
        - 1. not as simple / authoritative as his follower makes it out to be
        - 2. All your mental terms are dispositional not occurent
        - 3. Almost anything can be done when you have a relative connection in your mind
            - ie almost everything can be done when it is raining outside
        - 4. mental terms reappear
        - 5. Super Spartan Problem - having a mental state, without the accompanying behavior
            - but the reverse works too (super actor problem) can have behavior without the mental state

Mental States are actual states within your brain
    - central state, mental states are states in your central nervous system
    - mind body problem but there is a soulution
        - identity theory - right but not percise
            - very direct
            - claims that when we are talking about mind/brain
            - what we have are two different theories
            - lightning -> electricity
                - theory of lightning could be REDUCED
