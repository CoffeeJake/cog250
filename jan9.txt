===============

    - shifting gears towards the disccussion towards AI*
    - run into philosophers
    - linguists
    - all surrounding AI

AI is not a "new" idea
    - along with this a 45% employment

~autonomous cars in nearly 5 years
    - will push all drivers out of jobs

Many predictions about AI have been wrong
    - 2001 a space oddssy / skynet
    - goes way back the the begginnings of the scientific revolution

Philosophically interesting because its a mechanical approach to understanding the universe

Scientific Revolution
    - agaisnt the aristelian worldview(s/o hps100)
    - World View has 2 parts
        - a view of 
        - a theory of how we experience the world
            - currernt worldview doesnt include us 

Con-formity theory - not trying to be like everyone else
    - sharing the same form
    - the form is the gestalt of a thing

eidos = a sctructural functional organization synonem (SFO) (chair)
    - what makes a table different from a chair is its eidos
    - actually = acts like a "blank" (a chair is actually a chair) (hence it acts like a chair)
        - in ones mind they understand in their brain how a chair needs the structural functional organization
    - Theory: when you know something you have the same structure that comes from the thing
        - you really know something when you cause it to act like something you know
    - deep intamacy the structureal functional organization of your mind and reality

put any claim to knowledge to 3 basic tests
    1. extracting the information was functioning (an organ)
    2. the medium of translation is *clear*
    3. intersubjective agreement 
        - if you pass all these tests then your mind is the same as reality

still live day to day in an aeristotle style

shape as a metaphor for form
    - mind takes the shape/form of reality
    
Conformity theory on one side and the other side is:
*Geocentric* Worldview
    - theories existsted but not accepted
        - easily disconfirmed

Aristotle's Theory of Natural Motion

Layers around the earth like circles
    - more earth something has moves closers towards earth (more water = more water)
    - things are "pushing" one another, and they all have natural motion, "acting on purpose"

A Worldview = geocentric + conformity theory (and they positivley influence one another)(mutually support one another)

trade is magical
    - works better the longer the distance
        - longer the distance = greater chance of ship sinking
        - important to navigate ships better
        - aribic numerals (for calculations) + algebra (letters for variables) + "negative numbers" = powerful new ways of thinking
            - and more importantly play into looking at the sky

Math is better when the sun is the center than the earth
    - what this says is dont trust your senses or common senses
        - "Trust the Math"
        - we are all wrong
        - even if we're passing the tests
            - its all an illusion

mind ||| reality
    (this is a veil of appearence)

experience is what seperates us from reality
    - but gallileo says math that gets through
    - math puts mind in touch with reality

Aristotle had ALL the knowledge of his time
    - BUT THERE WAS NO MATH TO PROVE ANYTHING

"Math is the langugae of the universe" - Gallileo
    - first one to use math scientifically

Speed is triangular
    - uses math as a abstract symbol system to describe science
    - and gallileo also adds in the experimental method
        - relationship between variables
        - pretty much finds inertial motion
    - claims things dont have purpose, have accidental collision of forces
     
Primariy Qualities - mathematical properties (objective)

Secondary Qualities - non-properties, only exist in the mind as illusions (subjective)
    - shouldnt treat this unquestionably => then they cant be studied scientifcally

- everything is an illusion
    
Now onto Descartes
    - he invents psycho technology
    - follows a fly around a room to create cartesian coordinates
    - everything can be classified as equations 
    - computation is taking a formula and computing it
