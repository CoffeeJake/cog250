Last Week:


MICRO THEORY THEORY(MTT) aka the "Theory Theory":
    ADVANTAGES:
        - helps with many things that both prototype/classical theory had trouble with
        - captures logical relations that are found in the classical theory (yet not all relations are logical relations)
            - different kinds of relations, structured relations
            - a theory is NOT a definition 
        - explains things that the prototype theory got famous off of (fuzzy prototypes)
            - theories apply to the world in a fuzzy manner 
            - not all evidence is good evidence is for a theory (how good evidence is in supporting a theory)
        - does more than the theories before it (PT/classical)
            - an issue is that issues are either abstract or concrete
            - MTT has an answer
                2. explanetory relations ("because")
                1. things related by an explination
        - when attempting to combine theories, you must actually restructure theories to go together 
            - like chemistry when combining molecules (hydrogen / oxygen -> h20)
            - like how "pet fish" is different from "pet" / "fish"

Mary Douglas: Purity and Danger(1921 - 2007)
    - researcher on catagorization
    - finds out if something is impure or not
    - people disgusted by certain things even without logic just because of "codes"
    - ex. coats of a serial killer vs pen used by einstein
    - we eat some mammels but not others (ie dogs vs chickens)
    - people were trying to look at body morphology (the look of an animal) to two other things
        - Locamotion
        - Habitat (animal that lives in the sea SHOULD have fins / scales, not walk around and be spiky) 
            - why is this important
            - it is a microtheory used to explain how creatures behave
            - when its violated it fucks with the mind
            - is not convergent with classical / PT theories 
    - Clean things vs unclean things (like chinese meat vs every other meat)
    - uncanny valley is a good way to example because things that arent us but are nearly us (intercategorical)
    - When body morphology doesn't line up it frustrates out ability to categorize

- Human brains and having intelligence DOES NOT mean they have the ability to explai (theory is that no human brain can solve)
- 1. Epistemic Boudedness
    - cultural / historical VS biolocial boudedness 
    - we are not sure which of these it points to 
- 2. Choose another basic process (what we are talking about today)
    - should have started with memory instead of categories
- "Relationship between instances" is analagous to "theory and data"
- underdetermination of a thoery by its evidence (Reichenbach)
    - for every data set there is an infinite amount of functions to preform on it
    - of all of the conecpts we COULD have we select 1/2 that we find important in MTT
    - another issue of selection bias
    - the processes of selection has been unexplained so it cannot be a reliable theory

MEMORY
------

- memory is more basic than categorization

Common Sense Theroy (Eysenl and Keanne 1990)
    - Spatial Metephor for Memory
    - Memories are stable objects in a stable location (in a large abstract space) 
    - remembering = retrieve an object, and return it to consiousness
    - Nermonic Technique = visualize a room and see different topics/ideas at different place in the roo
        - powerful for training memory 
        - does not give power to EXPLAIN memory #it just seems like we can't explain anything
        - just because a metephor can TRAIN does not mean it can EXPLAIN ie Nermonic Tech

Carmicheal, Hogan, and Wrlter (1932)
    - this psych test has stood the test of time
    - (shown to people)eyeglass O---O dumbell(shown to others)
    - will return two different drawnings close to what was shown but more like the word they were told
        - memory is merging the drawing and the word
        - memory is RECONSTRUCTE
        - intead of carrying everything, it just takes peices that it needs to fit in to situations(adaptive!)

Signal Detection Theory
    - several words used in this theory
    - signal = information relevant to you
    - noise = information irrelvant to you
        - now the issue is that sometimes we dont know what is noise vs signal
        - pretend to be a deer, now you hear a noise in the bushes...lepord or wind?
        - an idea is to always assume either or...like always assuming lepord means always running away

Loftus and Zanni 1974
    - found out they can implement memories on children
    - experiment: showed a video of a car accident
    - asked 1) did you see THE broken headlight VS 2) did you see A broken headlight
        - much more likley to answer yes to (1) than compared to (2)
        - shows the ability to implement memories
    - 1) how fast was the car going when it smashed the bike vs 2) how fast was the car going when it collided with bike
        - (1) said car was "GOING REALLY FAST" compared to (2) car wasn't going that fast

Putnam (1979)
    - replicated experiment above (Loftus/Zani)
    - HYPNOSIS did not increase people's memory
    - in fact even more people were affected by the influence

Working Memory(WM) vs Long term Memory(LT)
    - working memory is functional (but when asked where the window  was in our room we only recall important details)
    - WM is also a bottleneck because it controlls the flow of information
    - one theory is called the limited capcaity mode (holding things on a countertop)
    - chunking create important relevant things to your brain and remembers them
    - Working Memory is a relevance filter
    - just proves that memory is really reconstructive in nature
