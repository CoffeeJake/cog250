music and its triggers on the brain from the angle of alshimers / ads
    - angle of philosophy of psychology
    - episodic memory is better than semantic memory
        - triggers / catalysts such as music can be explicity conjured
        - episodic memory with visual images triggered from music

Harnessing episodic memory is a essentially a lightweigh form of brainwashing
a great understanding of how to force it would do wonders
    - truly understanding how it works would give immense power
    - not only with your own ability to remember (alshimers)
        - a memory palace is pretty much this 
    - but with others, through advertisements (control others)
    - sometimes you can just sleep through an ad
    - but an add with a solid song can evoke emotions and memories
        - and good times
    - implicit learning and recall
    - full house theme song
    - news jingle opening, why things sound similar
    - chords to "all i want for chirstmas is you" maraiah carrey
        - look up vox video
    - propoganda songs, evoking emoiton
    - or the inception soundtrack
    - or a jingle for the pizza pizza number
    - SOCIAL MEDIA AND MEMES
        - how twitter / facebook can play into memeories
    - chainsmokers gaming the music industry with social mdeia
        - using hype machine as market research
        - tailering songs to each demographic
        - beefing on twitter on purpose to get more famous
        - sing about good times, relatable but fun
        - evoke a feeling of summer
    - country music does a similar thing
        - constanty singing about their life in the countryside
        - while their lives consist of touring around the US
        - and their boots are worht thousands

 Boltz (1991) also mentioned: 'Music can accentuate various qualities of visual activities and thereby enhance their perceptual salience.'

 - episodic memory outside of your own contril
 - what im I telling you thats new
    - so why is it important
    - why is it important that music can be used to trigger conceptual memory
    - why is it important that I even studied this
        - gotta look introspective
    - implanting memories

Saturday Morning ~11:30
    - music is more avliable than ever
    - its also influncing us more than ever before
        - with tv ads, podcast ads, yoututbe video intros, 
    - its also become easier to make and create
    - underratted in its power for behaviorism
        - often used for pleasure
        - sound and music must be harnessed for power
            - white noise
            - setting the mood at a party
        - meditation
        - working / drown out noise
        - gets you pumped
    - schools are stuck in old ways of learning
        - vervakes inovative lectures
        - the hps100 song
        - music and learning (cross reference alshimers)
    - as we move forward and mental health problems begin moving forward we need a way to combat them and music is a powerful tool to circumvent many of those issues
    - music a tool we use subconciously, but if we shift our opacity to exactly how we ustilize music, we can increase our mood, deal with mental health, and (insert other helpful thing about music)
    - as a socity we have solved many of the neccessary issues of survival in the 21st centry
        - yet a new challenger as emerged as mental health and being happy and dealing with mood
        - being able to manipulate yourself mentally though music is amazing
    - with the advent of weak ai society possibly taking over many jobs
        - and the possiblilty of Strong AI to replace nearly every job
        - requires the need of a new mental health movement 
        - supplemented by music
    - reference behavoirism about how we can condition ourselves through music (needs source)

Another large issue at hand, is how we can specifiy what kind of music does what
    - ie like is is chord progression, beat, tonality, color
    - possible fluffer if i need space in the essay
    - see advert paper, there is a wallace 1994 paper that explains this farily well
    - since theres no

Another fluff idea is to go into what the mental health issues this solves
    - along with how we have arrived at this point today
    - and what other things have been moving forward to solve this issue

Demensia / Alshimers
    - not only how its a great issue affecting the general population
    - also how it strains the care givers
    - possible fluff
    - use the paper to find other papers that support my ideas
    - mention that the lack of rigour plays into why there isnt better ideas behind it

Counter Arguments:
    - this is all placebo
    - you'll need music to continue practicing a skill
    - 

NOTE:
    - remember to argue that I am still talking about behaviorism
    - argue that its possible to condition yourslef/other
    - combination between mucisians / doctors / psychologists

MOVING FORWARD
    - having a more rigours testing suite for music and its effects
    - mental health data to be recorded through cell phones
        - technology helping in therpy
        - use music on a phone
        - theres already meditations on the phone
    - picking music that fits a culture
