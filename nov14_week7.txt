=================

Metcalfe - researcher on meta cognition
    - uses a cognative probe
        - Strup effect - colored ink (ex word "Blue" in orange ink)(interfernece effect)(due to automatic reading)
            - in the idea of "no insight" they claim you are just doing a really deep memory search
        - 1986 Feeling of Knowing (FOK)
            - ask if we can rememeber something
            - "Oh i know that" where you sorta feel something about knowing
                - a GOOD indicator of successful memory search
                - FOK => memory serach = "insight"
                    - which means FOK = "insight"
            - other than FOK being successful, also found it didnt not help solving an insight problem        
            - provides good evidence that something other than memory search is going on with problem solving
            - compare insight vs incremental problems 

Metcalfe and Wiebe 1987 (FEELING OF WARMTH)
============================================
    - insght problems and non insight problems
    - and providing feeling of warmth indicators every 10 seconds
    - 2 predicitons
        - 1. feeling of warmth would accuratly predict for non-insight
        - 2. a difference in the curves for feeling of warmth between the two problems
    - (non-insight - risiing curve) vs (insight - SUDDEN change)

Tausovec (1989, 1994)
Jousouvec and Bekraceuis (1995)
    - replicated experiement along with recording heart rate
        - (non insight - slope line going consistantly) vs (insight - curve that goes much faster towards the end)

Kaplen and Simon (1990) "In Search of Insight"
===============================================
    - attempting to explain Insight, but not challenged the *Search Inference Framework*
        - proposing two search spaces
            - 1. Primary - first you serach here (in the regular rules)
            - 2. Meta - then you serach here (then you searech for problem formulation)
                - the idea is you use Primary, realize its not working, go to Meta for reforming the problem, then solving back at Primary
            - ***INSIGHT IS WHEN YOU SWITCH SPACES, GO BACK, AND THEN SOVLE IT***
            - yet they didnt add to the idea of insight just explained when it happened?
                - used the design stance to make this, Theoretical debate + scientic competition
                - makes predictions about neuroscience
        CRTISISMS
        - its tight spacings, Meta is technically cognative space ***INFINITE REGRESSION***
        - stuck into a place of saying "its different but not" compared to the gestaltists
        - its hard to say what they want to say without falling into a contridiction
        
Notice Inverience Heuristic (NIH)(Gestaltian in nature)
=======================================================
    - across problem formulations, attempt to find a pattern of what isn't changing
    - good chance of chaning problem fomulation to a more solvable one
    - changes what you find salient or relevant to fix it
    - still relies on our ability to ZERO IN on relevant similarities(unexplained ability to do this)

Schooler et Al (1993-1995)
===========================
    - (1993) had people solving insight problems, and then people solving non insight problems
    - in BOTH conditions had people doing concurrent verbilizetion
        - speak allowed what you are currently doing (like in CTCI)
        - found it IMPAIRS insight problem vs it doesnt impair non-insight problems
        - Verbal Overshadowing - where speaking hinders performance(only insight problems)
        - reporting what you are doing VS what you are actually doing
        - introspection should NOT have unquestioning authority (saying vs acutally doing)
            - "What patterns are actually reliaable predictive of them solving the problem"
            - when people we saying they were using inferential strategies actually predicted success
            - no correlation between inferential strategies and success on insight problems vs success for infernetial strategies on NON insight problems
        - Speeded Reasoning View
            - when people are solving insight problems they are using them SO FAST that they cant be put into awareness or words(like really fast smash movement)
            
            CRITSISM
            - 1. why are we not using it all the time then
            - 2. computers are completly lacking in insight
            - could not find the correlation between non-insight vs insight 


Critisism:
    - Verbal Overshadowing - overly simplistic notion of attention (makes sense practically but breaks theoretically)***(BAD)

Then what really is at work? (issue with gestaltists is that they didnt give us any theory)

Individual Differences Methodology
==================================
A ==> Task
A ==> Insight

1. "Perceptual Resturcturing" = given a picture that blurry or pixelated and trying to guess it 
2. "Field Independance Task" = wheres waldo
3. "Remote Assostive Task(RAT)" = board magic death, what could be placed in front of all of them? BLACK 
4. "Category Instance Generation" = standard memory search "Diamond" then you would respond "Ruby, Saphire, etc" 

What they found most predictive was *Perceptual Restructuring* was the best for insight
It went downward from there

but it went backwards for Noninsight, so Category Instance Generation was the best and Perceptual Restructuring was the worse
Therefore they are seperate processess (probobly)

Gestaltans just critisze but never generate an alternateive theory

*** Mind is much more than inferences and beliefs ***

Baker Sennett and Ceci (1996)
==============================
    - *Cognative Leaping* = sometimes you are just doing things, and then the answer appears(bottom up)
        - as soon as you can tell me the final picture (as little hints as possible)
    - good congnative leaper if you can use FEWER cues and still find the right answer
    - depending on how good you are at being a leaper is how good you are at solving insight problems
    - points to a process called "Patter Completion"
        - often have to do multiple things at the same time

===== REVIEW =====

- ability to zero in on relevant information and avoid explosion
- problem formulation and why its crucial
- looking at insight, then broken down and looked at again once insight was gained
- 4 experiemnts to show whats wrong with the Gestalt framework (9 dot, outside the box)(no such thing as insight)
- conuse necessity vs sufficiency
- insight is not just standard memory search (feeling of warmth) different patterns between insight vs non insight problems
- kaplin and simon: came back to defend (SIF) there is insight (2 levels, primary vs meta)(and moving between them to solve the problem at hand) 
- lots of respect for problem formulation
- verbalilization - impairs insight problems(verbal overshadowing)
- people are using strategies but they are so fast that they arent even saying it
- double disaccociation (things for insight not useful for non insight and vice verse)
 2 different kinds of processes
